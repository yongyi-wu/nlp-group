The owners of the theatre, usually noble amateurs, charged the impresario with hiring a composer (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk.  In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce 'Der Schauspieldirektor' ('The Impresario').
